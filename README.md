# Stepper Motor-Driven Gripper with Worm Gear Mechanism  

An open-source, modular gripper design using a **stepper motor + worm gear** for precise and self-locking actuation. Designed for robotics applications with customizable control and simulation support.  

## Features  
- **Hardware Design**  
  - SolidWorks 2024 source files & STEP formats (modifiable geometry)  
  - Worm gear mechanism for high torque and backlash reduction  
- **Control & Firmware**  
  - CAN bus communication protocol  
  - Position control, torque control, and gripper distance-to-motor angle calibration  
- **Simulation & Integration**  
  - URDF model for ROS (Gazebo/MoveIt compatibility)  
  - BOM (Bill of Materials) for easy assembly  
- **Modularity**  
  - Adaptable to different controllers or end-effectors  

## Use Cases  
- Robotic grasping (industrial, research, or education)  
- Customizable force-sensitive gripper projects  
- ROS-based manipulation simulations
